## Project Overview

Welcome to the TradEco App! This mobile application is designed to empower individuals worldwide by providing accessible resources for responsible waste management, creative DIY projects, and community engagement. User can scan / list their waste and then they can get a DIY suggestion based on their waste or they can also share their waste to someone who needs it. User can also message others who have the missing waste materials, and then share their finished DIY project to the community to encourage others.

## Problem Statement

Individuals worldwide lack accessible resources for responsible waste management, DIY projects, and community engagement. The issue is compounded by the hoarding of many recyclable household items like cardboard, cartons, and others at home, coupled with uncertainty about their disposal. Furthermore, there is a lack of accessible platforms that can recommend DIY projects based on these waste materials. Additionally, individuals often encounter demotivation due to insufficient materials when engaging in DIY projects. We aim to mitigate these challenges by providing a solution that facilitates responsible waste management, offers DIY project recommendations, and fosters community engagement, thereby promoting sustainable living practices and reducing environmental impact.

## United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals and Target

SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production with Target 12.5: Substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse because TradEco focus on waste reduction, DIY projects, and sharing resources aligns perfectly with this goal. It promotes responsible consumption and minimizes environmental impact.

SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities with Target 11.6: Reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and waste management because TradEco encourages responsible waste management and DIY solutions within communities and contribute to cleaner cities and better living conditions.
